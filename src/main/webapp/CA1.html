    <p>Iteration one (Thursday - Friday): Start code setup + CI pipeline + JPA + Facade + facade test <br>
        The API description must be almost (we are using an iterative process) complete and available as a page on your deployed project. Please use this template  to document your endpoints<br>
        The plan for the three Iterations must be available as a page on your deployed project, including a class diagram, as it is at this stage of the project, as well as screen pics of your Kanban board.<br>
        The plan for the three Iterations can either be a copy of our suggestion below, or Iteration 1 as given below and your own plan for the remaining Iterations if your “product owner” agrees.<br>
        The CI-pipeline must be set up on GitHub Actions.<br>
        Some of the Entity Classes and the Facade(s) must be ready with supplementing tests<br>
